Started spotting mid-July and since approx. August 1st, I have been bleeding constantly, heavy enough to use pads and now it&#039;s almost November! I&#039;m sick of bleeding and forking out money for sanitary pads when I shouldn&#039;t be bleeding-well not as long as I have been now! Currently awaiting an ultrasound to see what is happening. I would like to change my contraceptive but my doctor won&#039;t let me :(\"\n",
      "\"I have been on the shot 11 years and until a month ago, never 1 period or even spotting.  A month ago, dark brown blood, awful odor, &amp; now I have had  a full blown period for 2 days. Not sure what to think.  I have continued the shot all of these years only because of the absent monthly.\"\n",
      "\"Ive had four shots at this point. I was on birth control pills for years due to excessive bleeding and extreme pain. Never had a regular period and would have them for over a week with HEAVY bleeding-im talking pad and tampon at the same time and it would still overflow. The pills only made it worse. Since the shot, i have had no issues. I have gained about 25 pounds, but that didnt happen until 2.5 months in. And i quit antidepressants so that could have been why i gained weight. After 2.5 months, there is no bleeding and no cramps. I almost forget what its like to have a period. And to be thruthful, my boyfriend cums inside me and has since ive been on the shot. Ive had no pregnancy scare or issues at all. Its super convenient and easy!\"\n",
      "\"I had a total of 3 shots. I got my first one before leaving the hospital after giving birth to my first and only child. I chose it on reccomendation from a friend who loves it. I stopped taking it September 2014, counting the 9 months I was pregnant I had not had a period in 2 years. I finally went to the Doctor since we were taking about having another baby. They did an ultrasound and said that the wall of my uterus was pretty thick, but nothing was done about it. About a week later it finally started. May 9 2015 I started spotting, then a regular to heavy flow. Its is not Oct. 25 2015 and I am still bleeding. My OB told me the only thing she could do for my is a D and C, which I seem to have to keep rescheduling. Don&#039;t take the shot!\"\n",
      "\"This is a horrible shot!! I got my first shot in August, ever since then everything has been terrible. I am not a normal crier and I cry at least twice a week over very small things or sometimes nothing. Before I was very happy, me and my boyfriend were at a good spot and I had a good relationship with everyone around me. Now I can&#039;t keep the same relationship with anyone because I constantly and moody or sad. The cramping during the first month was ridiculous, unlike any other cramping I experienced. My period didn&#039;t last that long like other ladies, but I did spot almost everyday. The depression has to be the worst side effect I experienced. It has taken over my life making it super hard for me to do the things I love, such as volleyball.\"\n"

    "We have created additional features related to the word count, unique word count, and letter count in each review. These features provide valuable insights into the characteristics and composition of the reviews in our dataset.By considering the word count in each review, we can understand the length or verbosity of the reviews. Longer reviews may indicate more detailed or comprehensive feedback, while shorter reviews may be more concise or to the point. This feature can help us identify the level of detail provided by the reviewers and potentially uncover any patterns or trends based on the length of the reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unique word count feature measures the diversity of vocabulary used in the reviews. By counting the number of unique words, we can gain insights into the lexical richness and variation in the reviewers' language. Reviews with a higher count of unique words suggest a broader range of expressions and potentially a more nuanced understanding of the drugs and conditions discussed.Additionally, the letter count feature provides a measure of the overall length of the reviews in terms of characters. This feature can be useful for identifying any potential limitations or restrictions on review length imposed by the platform or users. It can also provide insights into the level of detail or brevity in the reviewers' feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "By incorporating these features, we aim to capture and quantify various aspects of the review text, enabling us to analyze the relationship between these textual characteristics and other variables of interest, such as ratings or conditions. These features enhance our understanding of the reviews and can potentially reveal meaningful patterns or correlations that contribute to our project's objectives, such as sentiment analysis or condition prediction."
